# Advent of Code
This are some of my attempts at playing around with puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Currently I am investigating [oding-lang](https://odin-lang.org/), a general-purpose programming language built for high performance, modern systems and data-oriented programming.
